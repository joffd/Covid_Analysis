Description

A quick F# study on COVID data.

This project uses:
- Daily data for each country
- Associated population

The process uses a CSV F# Type Prodiver (https://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html)
to generate types directly from the Data.
I then use Deedle (Time Series Library for F# / .NET => https://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/) 
and F# Unit of Measures (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/units-of-measure),
then I produce some graphs.
